This project focuses on predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. Churn prediction is a critical business problem where companies aim to identify customers likely to stop using their service. The dataset used in this project is the popular Churn Modelling dataset, which includes customer demographics, account balance, tenure, activity level, and other relevant features. The target variable, Exited, indicates whether a customer has left (1) or stayed (0).
The data is first preprocessed using techniques like label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical variables, followed by feature scaling to standardize input values. After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. A feedforward neural network is then constructed using the Keras Sequential API. The model consists of an input layer, two hidden layers with ReLU activation, and a final output layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification. The network is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss and is trained over 100 epochs with a batch size of 32.
The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 85% on the test data. Evaluation metrics such as the confusion matrix and ROC curve are used to further analyze performance. The project is implemented using Python, with key libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. Potential improvements include hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, advanced feature engineering, and exploring ensemble models for better accuracy.
The repository is organized with separate folders for data and saved models, along with a Jupyter notebook that contains the complete pipelineâ€”from data cleaning to model training and evaluation. To run the project, simply clone the repository, install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt, and execute the notebook. This project serves as a practical demonstration of how deep learning techniques can be applied to solve real-world business challenges like churn prediction.
